Title: "C Programming - printf Team Project Specification"

Group Project Overview:

In this team project, the objective is to implement a function that generates formatted output according to specified format specifiers. The project involves handling various standard and custom conversion specifiers, as well as addressing specific requirements related to flag characters, length modifiers, field width, precision, and custom specifier behavior. The primary aim is to optimize performance by utilizing a local buffer.

Project Tasks and Objectives:

Develop a function to generate formatted output based on specified format specifiers.

Handle the following standard conversion specifiers: d, i, u, o, x, X.

Implement custom conversion specifiers as follows:

Custom conversion specifier: %r.
Custom conversion specifier: %p.
Address custom specifier behavior for each custom conversion specifier.

Manage flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers:

Flag characters to handle: 0, -.
Implement length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers:

Length modifiers to handle: l, h.
Manage field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Address precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

Handle additional custom conversion specifiers:

Custom conversion specifier: %s.
Ensure all the above functionalities work together seamlessly to produce formatted output.

Project Guidelines:

Utilize a local buffer with a capacity of 1024 characters to minimize calls to the write function and optimize performance.
Project Notes:

This project aims to create a robust and efficient implementation of the printf function, adhering to standard C conventions while accommodating custom behavior. The project involves handling a variety of conversion specifiers, flag characters, length modifiers, and precision settings to provide flexibility in formatting output.

The team should work collaboratively to ensure all requirements are met and thoroughly tested to produce accurate and well-formatted output in compliance with the specified format specifiers.
