We're working on a group project to implement your own version of the  function in C. The project has some specific requirements and guidelines that you need to follow. Here's a summary of what you should do:printf

Project Overview:

You need to create your own  function.printf
The code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using , with specific compilation options: .gcc-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
General Requirements:

Use an allowed editor (vi, vim, emacs).
All your code files should end with a new line.
Create a  file at the root of your project.README.md
Follow the Betty style for code formatting.
Avoid using global variables.
Limit each file to a maximum of 5 functions.
Do not include  functions in your C files, as the testing will be done with separate  files provided by the instructor.mainmain.c
Prototype all your functions in a header file called , and include guard this header.main.h
You are responsible for your  function; it won't be provided._putchar
Use authorized functions and macros, including , , , , , , and .writemallocfreeva_startva_endva_copyva_arg
Compilation:

Your code will be compiled using  with the specified flags.gcc
Your code should not contain any  functions in the root directory.main
Testing:

You should create your own test cases to ensure your  function works correctly. The provided  file is just an example._printfmain.c
Academic Integrity:

Do not plagiarize or copy code from others.
The project is meant for you to learn and implement your own solution.
Based on this information, it looks like you need to implement the  function following the rules and guidelines provided. Remember to thoroughly test your code with various format specifiers and edge cases to ensure it works as expected. Good luck with your project!_printf
 Project to be done in teams of 2 people (your team: Loay Awadalla, Najd Aleid)
