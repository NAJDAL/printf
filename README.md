# ALX Software Engineering Programme: Printf Project

Example:

```
int main(void)
{
    char *str = "Hello, World";
    _printf("%p\n", (void *)str);
}
```

Output:

```
0x561a6d7bab5d
```

- `%%`: Outputs the character `%`. No argument is transformed.

Example:

```
int main(void)
{
    _printf("%%\n");
}
```

Output:

```
%
```

#### Flags

The following flags can be applied:

- `+`: Forces a plus or minus sign (`+` or `-`) to precede the result for positive numbers. By default, only negative numbers are prefixed with `-`.

- `(space)`: Inserts a blank space before the value if no sign is present.

- `#`: With `o`, `x`, or `X` specifiers, it prefixes the value with `0`, `0x`, or `0X`, respectively, for non-zero values. With `e`, `E`, or `f` specifiers, it ensures that the output contains a decimal point even if no digits follow. For `g` or `G`, it behaves like `e` or `E`, but it does not remove trailing zeros.
